#Exercises

##Exercise 1:

Currenty, once logged in, there is no way for a user to log out again. Introduce this facility.

##Exercise 2:

There is only a single activities list - and all activities are inserted into this list. Refactor such that we are seeing the activities associated with the logged in user.

As we are using a Facade, this should not require extensive changes on any of the controllers.
