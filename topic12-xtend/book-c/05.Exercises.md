#Exercises (Assignment Ideas)

These labs are based on the application developed using this text:

- <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920010883.do>

The Yamba application here uses android API largely compatible with Android 3.0 and earlier.

However, it has been substantially revised to use a full suite of modern facilities introduced in subsequent releases:

-  <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023456.do>

A full set up repos for all the code in the revised application is here:

-  <https://github.com/learning- android>

(Toc is reproduce at the end of this page)

Specifically, the revised application includes:

- Fragments
- Actions and Action Bars
- Content Providers
- Intent Services
- Alarms
- Live Wallpapers

+ a number of minor improvements.

A version of YambaX (written in xtend) -  fully updated to include the above features, would be an interesting and useful assignment topic
