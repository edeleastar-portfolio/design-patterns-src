##Exercise 1: Users

Currently PacemakerApp.registerUser creates a local User object, and has no impact on the server. Change this such that, when registering a new user, the user object is created on the server.


##Exercise 2: Activities

PacemakerApp.getActivities and PacemakerApp.createActivities are still just working with the local copies. Rework these such that they are creating/retreiving activities to/from the pacemakerplay service.
