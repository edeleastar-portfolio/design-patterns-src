#Install Play

For this lab, the most stable version of eclipse maybe this one:

 - <http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html>

Which bundles support for the Play Framework.

Once you have installed it, run 'check for updates' form the Help menu to make sure you have the latest version.

Download and install the latest version of the Play Framework (currently 2.2.1)

- <http://www.playframework.com>

This will involve simply unzipping the archive, and placing the unzipped folder on the path.

NB: Please check your version of play! Play 2.1 (the earlier release) has a slightly different layout - so if you have this version please upgrade.
