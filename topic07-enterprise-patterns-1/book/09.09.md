#Form Input

Form handling in Play is well supported, and does not require significant boilerplate code. 

In the Application controller, define a new static attribute:

~~~java
  private static final Form<User> userForm = Form.form(User.class);
~~~

This will be used to read data and populate a User object. Now we can finalise the submitUser() method:

~~~java
  public static Result submitUser()
  {
    Form<User> boundForm = userForm.bindFromRequest();
    User user = boundForm.get();
    user.save();
    return redirect ("/");
  }
~~~

This method recovers the user entered data, reads it into a new User object, which we then save. The only requirement is that we keep the names of the user members directly aligned with the 'name' attributes in the `<input>` elements in the form:

~~~java
public class User extends Model
{
  //...
  public String firstname;
  public String lastname;
  public String email;
  public String password;
  //...
}
~~~

~~~xml
  //...
  <input placeholder="First Name" type="text" name="firstname">
  //...
  <input placeholder="Last Name"  type="text" name="lastname">
  //...
  <input placeholder="email"      type="text" name="email">
  //...
  <input type="password"                      name="password">
  //...
~~~

This is already the in place, so we should now have a simple UI, listing out the users. If we press the "Add User" button, then we should see a form which, if filled out, will take us back to the user page - to now include a new user.
