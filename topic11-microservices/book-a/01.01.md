#Setup

Install the latest version of node.js:

- <http://nodejs.org/download>

If install successful, node should be available on the command line:

~~~
$ node --version
v0.10.26
$
~~~

Create a folder called `pacemaker-node` - this will contain the node.js application. 

Change into this folder and enter the following command:

~~~
$ npm init
~~~

This will ask series of questions, which will result in the creation of a node module in this folder. We can accept the default for almost all questions as shown below:

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sane defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg> --save` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
