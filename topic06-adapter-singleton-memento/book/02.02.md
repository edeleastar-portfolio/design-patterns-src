#Memento I

Currently, your createActitivyButtonPressed method in the CreateActivity class looks like this:

~~~java
  public void createActivityButtonPressed (View view) 
  {  
    double distance = distancePicker.getValue();
    Activity activity = new Activity (activityType.getText().toString(), activityLocation.getText().toString(), distance);

    activities.add(activity);
    Log.v("Pacemaker", "CreateActivity Button Pressed with " + distance);
  }
~~~

We are creating an activity, and adding it to a list held locally. If the user would like to see the activities, this handler will switch views:

~~~java
  public void listActivityButtonPressed (View view) 
  {
    Log.v("Pacemaker", "List Activityies Button Pressed");
    Intent intent = new Intent(this, ActivitiesList.class);
    startActivity (intent);
  }
~~~

However, the activity is not able to access the list we have been updating with new activities.

This is the current Activity class:

~~~java
public class Activity 
{ 
  public Long   id;
  public String type;
  public String location;
  public double distance;

  public Activity()
  {
  }
  
  public Activity(String type, String location, double distance)
  {
    this.type      = type;
    this.location  = location;
    this.distance  = distance;
  }
  
  @Override
  public String toString()
  {
    return toStringHelper(this).addValue(id)
                               .addValue(type)
                               .addValue(location)
                               .addValue(distance)
                               .toString();
  }
  
  @Override
  public boolean equals(final Object obj)
  {
    if (obj instanceof Activity)
    {
      final Activity other = (Activity) obj;
      return Objects.equal(type, other.type) 
          && Objects.equal(location,  other.location)
          && Objects.equal(distance,  other.distance);    
    }
    else
    {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  @Override  
  public int hashCode()  
  {  
     return Objects.hashCode(this.id, this.type, this.location, this.distance);  
  }
}
~~~

Augment this class with the following features (as members of the class):

~~~java
  public Activity(Parcel in)
  {
    this.type = in.readString();
    this.location = in.readString();
    this.distance = in.readDouble();
  }

  @Override
  public int describeContents()
  {
    return 0;
  }

  @Override
  public void writeToParcel(Parcel dest, int flags)
  {
    dest.writeString(type);
    dest.writeString(location);
    dest.writeDouble(distance);
  }

  public static final Parcelable.Creator<Activity> CREATOR = new Parcelable.Creator<Activity>()
  {
    public Activity createFromParcel(Parcel in)
    {
      return new Activity(in);
    }

    public Activity[] newArray(int size)
    {
      return new Activity[size];
    }
  };
~~~

This will enable instances of the class to be 'parcelabe' - i.e. externalized to an external to another object.

We can transfer such a 'parcel' to another activity by adding it to a 'bundle' for that activity, and adding it as an 'extra' for the activity to pick up:


~~~java
  public void listActivityButtonPressed (View view) 
  {
    Log.v("Pacemaker", "List Activityies Button Pressed");
    Intent intent = new Intent(this, ActivitiesList.class);
    Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
    bundle.putParcelableArrayList("activities", activities);
    intent.putExtras(bundle);
    startActivity (intent);
  }
~~~
