##Exercise 1:

We have a list of activities in the CreateActivity class:

~~~java
  private ArrayList<Activity> activities = new ArrayList<Activity>();
~~~

Which is populated in the button event handler:

~~~java
  public void createActivityButtonPressed (View view) 
  {  
    double distance = distancePicker.getValue();
    Activity activity = new Activity (activityType.getText().toString(), activityLocation.getText().toString(), distance);

    activities.add(activity);
    Log.v("Pacemaker", "CreateActivity Button Pressed with " + distance);
  }
~~~

How do we display this in the ActivityList?

~~~java
public class ActivitiesList extends Activity
{

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
  {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activities_list);
  }

  @Override
  public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu)
  {
  / Inflate the menu; this adds items to the action bar if it is present.
    getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.activities_list, menu);
    return true;
  }
}
~~~

To populate the array - you will need to use an adapter:

- <htt/stackoverflow.cquestio50708populating-a-listview-using-arraylist>

This is a example of the adapter pattern:

- <htt/sourcemaking.cdesign_patteradapter>

But you will need to find a way of getting the arraylist of activities to the view. One technique is based on the memento pattern:

- <htt/sourcemaking.cdesign_pattermemento>

In android, this technique is implemented using the Parcelable class:

- <htt/developer.android.creferenandroParcelable.html>

See if you can have the list of activities displayed in the ActivitiesList view. We will present a solution to this in next weeks lab.
