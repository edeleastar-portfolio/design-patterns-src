#TableView

In the storyboard, introduce a TableViewController, and position it alongside the existing view in the scene as shown:

Drag and drop the 'initial scene' arrow from the existing controller to the front of the new controller:

(Note the 'This is the View Controller' will be automatically ticked in the Attributes Inspector on the right)

Run the app again - a different (table) view appears instead.
